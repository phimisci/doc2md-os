DOC2MD documentation
====================

DOC2MD is a CLI tool that allows for the conversion of DOCX files to Markdown. The tool is specifically designed to handle DOCX files that contain citations and references, but ODT files are supported as well. The tool uses Pandoc to convert the DOCX files to Markdown and then cleans the Markdown files to ensure that they are ready for publication. The software was initially developed to support the typesetting of articles in the `Philosophy and the Mind Sciences <https://philosophymindscience.org/>`_ journal.
